# Project Title

Udacity DAND Term1 Project2: Explore US Bikeshare Data
First submitted in or around March 2018 and received passing review that same month, after 1 or more revisions.

The purpose of this repository is to refactor the python script using the Pandas and Numpy libraries that were not included as part of the Term1 course material at the time that I was progressing through the Intro to Python course module.  so the first iterations of the project included only base python language loops and iterators.

I would like to make the code and script more compact and efficient, easier to read, all while learning how to branch from and commit to a repo on github.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

In order to review this project you will need:
-- some version of Python3 installed
-- a text editor to review my script in bikeshare.py
-- a terminal application to run the script

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

The packages/modules installed from the Python Standard library as part of this script are the following:

import csv
import pprint
import random
import datetime
import time
from collections import Counter

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

The csv files used for this project were the abbreviated versions for the 3 cities uploaded to the Project website on or around 21st Feb.  their number of records is 300,000 in each file.

For my project they are titled as follows:
-- chicago.csv
-- new_york_city.csv
-- washington.csv

The reviewers script may throw errors if the same data is not used so please ensure that the correct files are read into the script.
